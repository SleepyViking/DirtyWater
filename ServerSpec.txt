DLGP MUD Server protocol

Abstract:

	The model we will follow is one with a central Server, and many Clients. Duh.
	
	Clients submit Requests to the Server for particular things, such as to log into a user 
	account, or to please move the entity Player some number of units in the X and Y directions, 
	or to use an attack etc. etc.

	The Server processes these requests, and decides how to act on them (based, for instance, on
	the permission level of the user that has sent the request). Meanwhile, it is also constantly
	sending updates to the positions of entities in the world, which the client in turn interprets
	to render for the player. All of this must happen fast enough for the player to meaningfully
	react to the world around him.
	
	
	Using a limited buffer size, the question of how to efficiently encode and decode data between
	a server and client arises. THIS PROTOCOL WILL FOCUS ON THE FORMAT OF REPLIES OR UPDATES THAT 
	THE SERVER WILL SEND TO THE CLIENT.
